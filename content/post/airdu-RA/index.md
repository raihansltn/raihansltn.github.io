## Overview

On Thursday, April 17th, 2025. I was chosen to be the research assistant for Machine Learning Laboratory/Division of my research group. My Research Group, AIRDU (Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Unit) is one of two research groups of [Computer Science Department, Universitas Ary Ginanjar](https://uag.ac.id/ilmu-komputer) (UAG). With this, I'll start to build models for our upcoming projects, while also conduct experiments with ML and Deep Learning algorithms. Other than that, I will also provide research assistance within office hours, for research group members, especially some new students that will be attached to this division.
