FunLocker is a password-locked file decryptor (so far only have .docx and .pdf file decryptors). FunLocker uses a set of base passwords provided by the user to attempt to unlock encrypted files. The program will generate various combinations of these passwords to maximize the chances of successfully decrypting the file. This is useful if you have a list of possible passwords that you commonly use and need to recover access to a file that has been encrypted with one of these passwords.
