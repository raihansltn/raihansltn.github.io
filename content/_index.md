        I'm a dedicated Junior Researcher with a passion for exploring diverse and impactful fields. In short, my research interests are to discover and understand critical security issues, and then to design and develop innovative solutions to address these issues.
        
        To be precise, my research areas and interests:
        - Privacy Compliance and Enforcement
        - Secure ML Systems
        - Cyber Threat Intelligence
        - NLP/ML-assisted Anomaly Detection and Vulnerability Discovery
        - side-channel attacks on wireless networks
        - log and traffic analysis for attack detection and threat intelligence
        - DDoS mitigation using SDN
        - firmware security and reverse engineering
        - anti-forensic technique and mitigation
        
        My work itself, spans across cybersecurity, where I specialize in uncovering and analyzing security flaws and bugs to strengthen systems against vulnerabilities. In addition, I delve deeply into the realms of artificial intelligence and machine learning, aiming to unlock innovative applications and refine existing methodologies.

        With a multidisciplinary approach, I strive to contribute meaningful insights that advance technology and its integration into society. Whether itâ€™s through exploring cutting-edge algorithms, identifying potential threats in digital infrastructures, or designing robust AI models, my goal is to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

        Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations to solve complex challenges and drive innovation. Letâ€™s create something impactful together!
